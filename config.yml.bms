  ## Credential validation
  ## - When running Locker/Locker Services remotely, started containers will be
  ##   protected (only the starting user plus admins can access).
  ##
  ## - This is handled by 2 services pointed to by redirect_url and validate_url.
  ##   Your login credentials (e.g. session cookie, etc.) will be validated at 
  ##   validate_url and if the validation fails you will be redirected to redirect_url
  ##   to login (that then redirects you back to Locker upon successful login).
  ##
  ## - We use SiteMinder inside BMS for this, but you can create your own services at 
  ##   redirect_url and validate_url to handle in your own way.
  redirect_url: "https://smusath.net.bms.com/rdproxy/redirect.cgi"
  validate_url: "https://smusath.net.bms.com/rdproxy/validate.cgi"

  ## The redirect_url service should take a single param for the url to
  ## redirect to upon successful authentication and that is given here:
  REDIRECT_TARGET_ARGNAME: 'url'

  ## The name of the cookie that holds your SSO session cookie; 
  ## this is sent on calls to redirect_url and validate_url
  SSO_SESSION_COOKIE_NAME: 'SMSESSION'

  ## First configure an image registry to go against. You can go against either
  ## a private Docker registry (see https://docs.docker.com/registry/) or AWS ECR

  ## To go against private Docker registry, set values for registryName and repo_name;
  ## set to empty strings if going against ECR.
  registryName: "docker.rdcloud.bms.com:443"

  ## Note: set repo_name to None to be able to see and pull all repos from the registry
  repo_name: rr

  ## Set to empty (and useEcrFlag=False) to not go against a registry
  ## and allow pulls from them (just locally stored images will be shown and used))
  registryUrl: "https://docker.rdcloud.bms.com:443"

  ## To go against ECR set values for the following four 
  ## (set to empty strings if going against private Docker registry):
  ecr_domain: "483421617021.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
  ecr_registry_id: "483421617021"
  aws_region: "us-east-1"
  ecr_repo_name: rr

  ## Change this to the Locker image at your own Docker registry where the Locker image can be pulled from.
  ## (note that if you already have built it and it is available in your local machine's Docker
  ## then you won't need to pull from this and this is sort of optional in that case).
  locker_image: "docker.rdcloud.bms.com:443/rr:locker_devtest"

  ## List usable ports, otherwise use '("ALL")' for all ports above 5000
  ## usable_ports='("10000" "10001" "10002" "10003" "10004" "10005" "10006" "10007" "10008" "10009")'

  ## If true, will go against ECR as image registry, otherwise against the private Docker registry
  useEcrFlag: False

  ## To reduce image size, you can optionally install content to 
  ## an attached network drive (EFS, etc.) or a local host path.
  ## Set imageDriveNetwork to empty value to not mount/use network drive
  ## that contains extra image content (R libraries, etc.).
  ## If admin has copied the offline image content to a shared local path,
  ## specify that in imageDriveLocalPath; otherwise set to empty to not use.

  ## Configuration of network drives to mount using sshfs:
  ## Format of each record is: [<DESCRIPTIVE_NAME>,<ID>,<HOSTNAME>,<PATH_AT_HOSTNAME>,<CONTAINER_MOUNT_POINT>,<USER_AT_HOSTNAME>,<VPN_OR_CORPORATE_NETWORK_REQUIRED_TO_MOUNT>,<SHOW_MOUNT_OPTION_CHECKBOX>,<MOUNT_OPTION_DEFAULT>]
  ## <DESCRIPTIVE_NAME>: If empty or none, will default to <HOSTNAME>; label of checkbox where user can check to mount or not (e.g. 'mount Stash?')
  ## <ID>: Unique value (among all the sshfsMounts) identifying this record; will be used as the name of the checkbox in the start container form
  ## <HOSTNAME>: remote host from which you want to sshfs mount a directory
  ## <SHOW_MOUNT_OPTION_CHECKBOX>: Set to true value (e.g. 1) to show the "mount <DESCRIPTIVE_NAME>?" checkbox (in templates/start_container_form.html); setting to false value (e.g. 0) hides it. Whether hidden or shown, the checkbox will still be in the page and its value submitted with the form (see <MOUNT_OPTION_DEFAULT> where you can set it default checked or not).
  ## <MOUNT_OPTION_DEFAULT>: Set to empty string to not have the "mount <DESCRIPTIVE_NAME>?" checkbox (in templates/start_container_form.html) checked by default; 'checked' causes it to be checked by default.
  ## <PATH_AT_HOSTNAME>: The path to mount at <HOSTNAME>; note that any occurence of __REMOTE_USER__ will be replaced with <USER_AT_HOSTNAME> and any occurence of __DOCKER_HOST_USER__ will be replaced by the Docker host user and any occurence of __RUNASUSER__ will be replaced with runAsUser (user inside container)
  ## <CONTAINER_MOUNT_POINT>: The path to mount inside the container; note that any occurence of __REMOTE_USER__ will be replaced with <USER_AT_HOSTNAME> and any occurence of __DOCKER_HOST_USER__ will be replaced by the Docker host user and any occurence of __RUNASUSER__ will be replaced with runAsUser (user inside container)
  ## <USER_AT_HOSTNAME>: The remote user at the host where the drive to be mounted is located, __RUNASUSER__ will be replaced by runAsUser and __DOCKER_HOST_USER__ will be replaced by the Docker host machine username --- if empty value or None then default is just the Docker host machine username
  sshfsMounts:
    - DESCRIPTIVE_NAME: 'Stash'
      ID: 'stash'
      HOSTNAME: 'stash.pri.bms.com'

  ## Proxy env var settings that can be set in started containers depending
  ## on values for proxyHandling and checkCorpNetworkVPNServer
  proxies:
    HTTPS_PROXY: 'http://proxy-server.bms.com:8080'
    HTTP_PROXY: 'http://proxy-server.bms.com:8080'
    FTP_PROXY: 'http://proxy-server.bms.com:8080'
    NO_PROXY: '.bms.com,169.254.169.254,localhost,.celgene.com'
    https_proxy: 'http://proxy-server.bms.com:8080'
    http_proxy: 'http://proxy-server.bms.com:8080'
    ftp_proxy: 'http://proxy-server.bms.com:8080'
    no_proxy: '.bms.com,169.254.169.254,localhost,.celgene.com'

  ## Certain actions or capabilities (e.g. mounting of specific network drives, etc.)
  ## are only available when you are running Locker on a VPN or organization/corporate
  ## network. So Locker needs a way to determine that, and it does that by pinging a
  ## server that is only reachable if you are on the VPN or organization/corporate network.
  ## This server will be pinged, and if ping returns something (doesn't time out) it
  ## will be assumed you are on a VPN or organization/corporate network.
  checkCorpNetworkVPNServer: 'proxy-server.bms.com'

  ## Takes these possible values: 'set','unset','check';
  ## used for both Locker itself and app (i.e. RStudio, Jupyter, etc.)
  ## containers that Locker starts.
  ## 'set':   Proxy settings from proxies hash are always set, 
  ##          no matter what (after unsetting any pre-existing 
  ##          proxy settings set when the image was built, 
  ##          i.e. as ENV lines)
  ## 'unset': Any proxy settings that had been set in the image
  ##          when it was built (as ENV lines) are unset and no
  ##          new proxy settings are set (so effectively, there 
  ##          will be no proxy settings in the container)
  ## 'check': Proxy settings from proxies hash are set (after 
  ##          unsetting any pre-existing proxy settings set when 
  ##          the image was built, i.e. as ENV lines) if on corporate
  ##          network/VPN as determined by pinging checkCorpNetworkVPNServer
  proxyHandling: 'check'

  ## Your GitHub server (e.g. enterprise GitHub server);
  ## containers will be setup to allow SSH clones and actions against it
  githubUrl: "biogit.pri.bms.com"

  ## The generic username that users will be inside the container 
  ## (e.g. they will SSH in under this username and this will be
  ## what shows (e.g. in RStudio terminal) if they execute 'whoami')
  containerUser: 'domino'

  ## The home directory inside the container of containerUser 
  ## (no trailing forward slash please)
  containerUserHomedir: '/home/domino'

  ## The network ports to use for the main app and also (optionally,
  ## if started) vscode, for local and remote started containers:
  mainAppContainerPort_local: "8888"
  vscodeContainerPort_local: "8887"
  mainAppContainerPort_remote: "80"
  vscodeContainerPort_remote: "81"

  ## User configuration info is kept in this directory in home dir:
  userConfigDirName: '.locker'

  ## Regexes used to determine which images are runnable by Locker.
  ## - Image names must match one of these regexes.
  ## 
  ## - The images will be displayed on the "images" page in the
  ##   order of these regexes (i.e. image names matching the first
  ##   regex are shown first, then image names matching the second one
  ##   are seconds, etc. until last are image names that don't match
  ##   any of the regexes). 
  ## 
  ## - Pulled images are shown before unpulled images. 
  ## 
  ## - Config values can be interpolated by surrounding
  ##   them in curly brackets.
  ##   For example, 
  ##      if 
  ##        registryName: "myRegistry"
  ##        repo_name: "myRepo"
  ##
  ##      then:
  ##          ^{registryName}/{repo_name}:latest$
  ##
  ##      will result in:
  ##          ^myRegistry/myRepo:latest$
  ##
  ## - This also works for custom-defined yaml variables in this config.
